**4. Innovative and Rarely Studied Research Questions:**

Based on this data, here are some potentially fruitful research questions:

*   **Communication:** How do individuals and communities construct and disseminate narratives of resistance against perceived authoritarianism in online spaces like BlueSky? How do emotional appeals (fear, anger, hope) shape the reception and spread of these narratives?
*   **Political Science:** What factors influence public trust in government institutions during times of perceived constitutional crisis? How do social media platforms contribute to or mitigate political polarization and negative partisanship?
*   **Journalism:** How do alternative media sources and citizen journalists frame political events compared to mainstream media outlets? What are the effects of these framing differences on public opinion and political engagement?
*   **Media Studies:** How does the affordances of decentralized social media platforms (like Bluesky) shape the formation and maintenance of activist communities compared to more centralized platforms? What are the effects of platform algorithms on the visibility and spread of misinformation/disinformation related to political issues?
*   **Discourse Analysis:** How is the language of fascism and authoritarianism being deployed and contested in online political discourse? What are the rhetorical strategies used to frame political opponents as threats to democracy and the rule of law?
*   **Media Ecology:** How does social media use intersect with individual mental health and well-being? How do users cope with "doomscrolling" and the emotional toll of constant political turmoil?
*   **Public Opinion:** What is the correlation between online political discourse and offline political participation (e.g., protesting, donating, voting)?
*   **Cultural Studies:** How are collective identities (e.g., "resisters," "MAGA supporters") being constructed and reinforced through social media narratives and online interactions?
*   **Misinformation Studies** How can we leverage data to identify and mitigate the spread of misinformation related to election integrity and the democratic process?
*   **Social Network Analysis** How has the online landscape of trust and distrust evolved in response to major political and social events, and what are the implications for social cohesion?
