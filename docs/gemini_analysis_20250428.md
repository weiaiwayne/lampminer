Okay, here's an analysis of the BlueSky posts, structured as requested:

**1. Key Social, Political, or Cultural Trends:**

*   **Anti-Trump Sentiment & Political Anxiety:** Overwhelmingly negative views of Trump, concern about authoritarianism, erosion of democratic norms, and potential for violence. There's a strong sense of resistance and a call for action.
*   **Canadian Election Engagement:** High engagement with the Canadian election, often framed in relation to US politics (relief at a non-Trumpian outcome).
*   **Economic Concerns:** Worries about tariffs, inflation, supply chain issues, and economic inequality. Focus on the potential negative impacts on ordinary citizens, particularly those relying on Medicaid.
*   **Skepticism towards Institutions:** Distrust of government, corporations (e.g., Disney), and even media (CBC, NPR).

*   **Humorous and Sarcastic:** Use of humor, often dark or sarcastic, as a coping mechanism and a form of political commentary.
