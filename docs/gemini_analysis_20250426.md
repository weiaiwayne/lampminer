**4. Innovative and Rarely-Studied Research Questions:**

*   **The Role of "Micro-Activism" on Social Media:** How do small acts of resistance and information sharing on platforms like BlueSky contribute to broader political mobilization and attitude change?
*   **Ethical Reasoning & Framing of AI Discussions:** How do differing ethical frameworks (e.g., consequentialism vs. deontology) shape the online discourse about AI risks and benefits? Can that difference be predicted by other factors?
*   **The Relationship Between Mistrust and Engagement:** How does distrust in mainstream media influence the consumption and production of news and information on alternative platforms?
*   **Construction of Identity & Political Mobilization:** To what extent does online identity (e.g. follower count, pronouns) influence a user's capacity to impact or organize people around political or social justice issues?
*   **The Impact of Policy Discussion on Community Building:** How do communities that form around specific policy challenges (e.g., book bans, ICE policies) differ from communities based on shared interests or values?
*   **Comparative Platform Analysis:** How do the affordances (design features) of different social media platforms (e.g., BlueSky vs. Twitter/X) shape the nature of political discourse and the spread of misinformation?
*   **The Role of Affect in Mobilization:** Does a community with a more negative affect toward a subject (say, the current administration) perform better or worse in driving mobilization when compared to a community with a more positive affect around other factors (say, policy-making alternatives)?
*   **Echo Chamber Effects:** How is political homogeneity and tribalism perpetuated on the fediverse/distributed social networks?
