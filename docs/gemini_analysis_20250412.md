**4. Innovative and Rarely-Studied Research Questions:**

*   **The intersection of birth rates, pro-natalism rhetoric, and political ideologies.** What are the cultural and political anxieties driving pro-natalist discourse, and how do they intersect with broader debates about gender, race, and national identity?
