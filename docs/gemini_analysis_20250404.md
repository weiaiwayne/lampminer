There's also a questioning of the validity and trustworthiness of economic data released by the current administration.
*   **Political Polarization and Distrust:** The posts reflect a highly polarized political environment, with strong anti-Trump sentiments. There's distrust of institutions, politicians, and the media, with accusations of complicity and propaganda. The impact of this distrust on everyday life is a recurring theme.
*   **Critique of Corporate Power and "Rationalism":** There is significant concern over the undue influence of corporations and wealthy individuals on politics, the role of "rationalist" ideology in skewing perceptions, and a perceived lack of accountability for powerful entities.
